# Space Accounts

This is the github page for the website of SpaceAccounts.com or SpaceAccounts.github.io . 

Space Accounts is a SaaS cloud invoicing and online payment system also accepting Bitcoins. Space Accounts is built using Python-Flask and uses Angular UI for the frontend.  User Auth is decentralized with JSON web tokens. 

Eventually I'll build this out to a full double entry accounting system with a bitcoin capital gains ledger, CRM, Payroll and all that jazz.... but first the foundation. ;) 

This Repo, the website, is built using Angular UI & HTML5
